## Installation

To send errors to Rollbar from your Python application you should use 
[pyrollbar](http://github.com/rollbar/pyrollbar) notifier library. Install pyrollbar with pip:

```python
pip install rollbar
```

## Send a Message

You'll need your project's server-side access token to initialize the Rollbar notifier. Sending
a message to Rollbar is as simple as:

```python
import rollbar

rollbar.init('{{ access_token }}')
rollbar.report_message('Rollbar is configured correctly')
```

A few seconds after you execute this code, the message should appear on your project's "Items" page.

## Report an Error

To report errors to Rollbar, you'll need to call the Rollbar notifier in your exception handling code.

```python
import rollbar

rollbar.init('{{ access_token }}')

try:
    b = a + 1
except:
    rollbar.report_exc_info()

```
A few seconds after you execute this code, an exception should appear on your project's "Items" page.
This item will include the basic exception information and a stack trace, along with the values of
local variables and the arguments passed to each function at each frame in the stack trace.
## Add Rollbar to Your Python Application

Once you've verified that the notifier is configured correctly and can communicate with Rollbar, you'll
want to add the notifier to your existing applications. For additional configuration options and 
instructions for using Rollbar with specific web frameworks, see:
